      <h1>Tuatara</h1>
      <p> 
        Tuatara are greenish brown and grey, and measure up to 80 cm (31 in) from head to tail-tip and weigh up
         to 1.3 kg (2.9 lb) with a spiny crest along the back, especially pronounced in males. They have two rows 
         of teeth in the upper jaw overlapping one row on the lower jaw, which is unique among living species.
         Tuatara are the only surviving members of the order Sphenodontia. This order was well represented by many 
         species during the age of the dinosaurs, some 200 million years ago. All species except the tuatara declined 
         and eventually became extinct about 60 million years ago.tuatara, (genus Sphenodon), any of two species of 
         moderately large lizardlike reptiles endemic to New Zealand. Although a growing number of geneticists contend 
         that all living tuatara belong to the same species, two species of extant tuatara are recognized, Sphenodon 
         guntheri and S. punctatus

      <h1>Tree Frogs</h1>
      <p>   
        Tree frogs are usually tiny, as their weight has to be carried by the branches and twigs of their habitat.
         While some reach 10 cm (4 in) or more, they are typically smaller and more slender than terrestrial frogs. 
         Typical for "tree frogs" are well-developed discs on the finger and toe tips.
         In general, frogs have protruding eyes, no tail, and strong, webbed hind feet that are adapted for 
         leaping and swimming. They also possess smooth, moist skins. Many are predominantly aquatic, but some
         live on land, in burrows, or in trees. A number depart from the typical form
         Tree frogs are found on every continent except Antarctica, but they're most diverse in the tropics
          of the western hemisphere. About 30 species live in the United States, and over 600 can be found in South 
          and Central America. Not surprisingly, lots of tree frogs are arboreal, meaning they live in trees.
          tree frogs are not poisonous to humans. However, their toxins can affect other animals, even pets.
         It is understandable why most people think of most frog species as poisonous

      <h1>Tiger salamander</h1>
      <p> 
        Tiger salamanders are approximately six to eight inches (15 to 20 centimeters) long.
         These amphibians have dark gray, brown, or black bodies with brownish-yellow markings.
          In some subspecies, the yellow markings are large spots or stripes, while other subspecies have 
          small yellow, irregularly shaped spots.The tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) is a species of
         mole salamander and one of the largest terrestrial salamanders in North America.
         Eastern tiger salamanders have thick bodies with yellow blotches covering their dark brown or black skin.
          The spots have no set size or pattern, and can vary throughout their expansive range. Their bellies are 
          yellowish or olive green. Their heads are large with a broad, rounded snout.
          Salamanders control pests by eating insects like mosquitos and by becoming food for larger animals. 
          Their moist, permeable skin makes salamanders vulnerable to drought and toxic substances, so they are
           exceptional indicators of ecosystem health.

      <h1> Newts</h1>
      <p>   
        Newts are a type of amphibian that belong to the family Salamandridae. They are found throughout the world,
         and are particularly common in temperate regions. Newts are semi-aquatic creatures, spending part of their time
         in water and part of their time on land. They are characterized by their smooth, moist skin and distinctive tail,
       which they use for swimming. In terms of food, newts feed on a variety of small aquatic and terrestrial animals.
        This may include insects, worms, snails, crustaceans, and small fish. They are opportunistic feeders, and will eat
         anything they can fit in their mouth. In the wild, newts hunt for food by sight, using their keen sense of vision to spot prey.
        Newts are typically kept as pets in captive environments, where they are fed a variety of commercially available foodstuffs.
         This may include live or frozen foods, such as brine shrimp, bloodworms, and daphnia, as well as dried or pelleted foods.
          Some newt species are also fed live feeder fish, but this is generally considered to be a less ethical method of feeding.
         In order to maintain a healthy diet, it is important to provide newts with a varied and nutritionally balanced diet. 
         This can be achieved by offering a variety of different food types, and by supplementing their diet with vitamins and minerals.
         It is also important to ensure that newts are not over-fed, as this can lead to health problems and a reduced lifespan. 
         In conclusion, newts are a type of amphibian that require a varied and nutritionally balanced diet in order to thrive.
         They feed on a range of small aquatic and terrestrial animals, and can be fed a variety of commercially available foodstuffs. 
         With proper care and nutrition, newts can be happy and healthy pets for many years to come.
