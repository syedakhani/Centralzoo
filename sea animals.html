      <h1>StarFish</h1>
      <p>Starfish, also known as sea stars, are fascinating creatures that belong to the phylum Echinodermata and are found in various ocean habitats worldwide. These animals are known for their unique star-like shape, with five arms radiating from a central point. Starfish are important members of the ocean ecosystem, playing a vital role in maintaining the balance of their environment. They feed on a variety of prey, including mollusks, barnacles, and mussels, which they grip with their arms and use their specialized stomachs to digest. The shape and size of their arms and spines vary greatly between species, 
        with some species growing up to three feet in diameter. Starfish are also known for their remarkable regenerative abilities, being able to grow new arms and regenerate damaged tissues. Despite their importance in the ocean, starfish populations are vulnerable to human activities such as overfishing, pollution, and climate change, making it essential for us to protect these fascinating animals and their habitats. <br> Starfish, also known as sea stars, are fascinating creatures that belong to the echinoderm family. As predators, they play an important role in maintaining balance in the ocean's ecosystem. Starfish feed on a variety of prey including mollusks, clams, mussels, and small fish.

        One of the most unique things about starfish is their method of feeding. Unlike most other predators, starfish don't have teeth or a mouth, so they use their arms to pry open their prey. Once the food is exposed, the starfish will extend its stomach through its mouth and engulf the prey.

      <h1>Angel Fish</h1>
      <p>  
       Angelfishes are native to the freshwaters of tropical South America and may grow to a length of about 15 cm (6 inches).
       They are commonly silvery with vertical dark markings but may be solid or partially black. They are carnivorous and take care
       of their eggs and young. There are 90 species of marine angelfish. These omnivorous fish live in the Indian, Atlantic,
        and western Pacific oceans. They swim in and out of coral reefs in shallow areas of water.New colors and patterns of
         angelfish are constantly being developed, but some of the most well-known varieties include silver (or wild type), veil,
          koi, zebra, marble, albino, leopard, and platinum.In their natural habitats, angelfish are technically omnivores,
       because they will sometimes consume -some plant material. But mostly, they hunt for prey like small crustaceans, insects, 
       larvae and other meaty foods.Angelfish are very peaceful as far as cichlids go. If you have a breeding pair, expect them to
        become a little more aggressive, however, especially with their own species. Angelfish will also defend their nest site against 
        any intruders after breeding

      <h1>Golden Fish</h1>
      <p>
        The Goldfish (Carassius auratus) is a freshwater fish in the family Cyprinidae of order Cypriniformes. It is commonly kept as a pet in indoor aquariums, and is one of the most popular aquarium fish. Goldfish released into the wild have become an invasive pest in parts of North America.
        Goldfish are golden-yellow or orange fish that live as pets in fish tanks and human-made ponds. They are freshwater fish so they can't live in salty water. They need large enough tanks or ponds to live in and be healthy, and enjoy having other goldfish around them. They are omnivores, eating both plants and animals.
        Goldfish have two sets of paired fins and three sets of single fins. They don't have barbels, sensory organs some fish have that act like taste buds. Nor do they have scales on their heads. They also don't have teeth and instead crush their food in their throats.
        Goldfish spend lots of time exploring their tanks to entertain themselves, so set up your tank in such a way as to provide lots of stimulus for your fish. Gravel, plants, ornaments and airflows can all make life interesting for your fish

      <h1>Jellyfish</h1>
      <p>
        Jellyfish have tiny stinging cells in their tentacles to stun or paralyze their prey before they eat them.
        Inside their bell-shaped body is an opening that is its mouth. They eat and discard waste from this opening. 
        As jellyfish squirt water from their mouths they are propelled forward.Jellyfish have no brain, heart, bones or eyes.
        They are made up of a smooth, bag-like body and tentacles armed with tiny, stinging cells. These incredible invertebrates
        use their stinging tentacles to stun or paralyse prey before gobbling it up. The jellyfish's mouth is found in the centre of its body.
        Jellyfish eat many different types of things, such as small plants (phytoplankton), copepods (crustacean zooplankton), fish eggs and other
        small fish called larvae; they also eat the planktonic eggs and young stages (also called larvae) of many different kinds of marine animals.
        Lacking brains, blood, or even hearts, jellyfish are pretty simple critters. They are composed of three layers: an outer layer, called the 
        epidermis; a middle layer made of a thick, elastic, jelly-like substance called mesoglea; and an inner layer, called the gastrodermis.

      <h1>Dolphin</h1>
      <p>Dolphins are one of the most intelligent and playful mammals in the world. They belong to the family Delphinidae and are found in oceans, rivers, and seas all over the world. They have a streamlined body and a long, narrow beak that they use to catch fish and squid. Dolphins communicate with each other using a variety of sounds including whistles, clicks, and body language.

        Dolphins feed mainly on fish and squid, and they hunt by using echolocation to locate their prey. They are known to work together in groups to herd and capture schools of fish, and they have even been observed using tools, such as seaweed, to corral fish.
        
        Dolphins are social animals and often form tight-knit pods, consisting of up to a dozen individuals. They are also known to form bonds with other species, including humans, and are often kept in captivity for entertainment and research purposes.
        
        In the wild, dolphins face threats from fishing and hunting, as well as from pollution and habitat loss. Conservation efforts, including marine protected areas and fishing regulations, are in place to help ensure the survival of these magnificent creatures. <br>
        Dolphins are not a type of fish, but rather a type of marine mammal.
