        <h1>Cockatoo</h1>
        <p> The Cockatoo is a highly social bird species that is known for its distinctive crest of feathers on their head. In the wild, they are primarily found in the tropical regions of Australia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Cockatoos are omnivores, meaning they eat both plants and animals as a part of their diet. In the Central Zoo, Cockatoos are typically fed a balanced diet of seeds, nuts, fruits, and vegetables. They also receive occasional treats such as hard-boiled eggs, crackers, and bird-friendly biscuits.

          It is important to note that Cockatoos require a lot of mental and physical stimulation to keep them healthy and happy. This includes daily opportunities for exercise, such as climbing, playing with toys, and foraging for food. At the Central Zoo, keepers provide the Cockatoos with a variety of toys and puzzles to keep them entertained and engaged.
          
          Overall, the Cockatoo is a highly intelligent and social bird that requires proper care and attention to maintain their health and happiness in captivity. By providing them with a nutritious diet, opportunities for physical and mental stimulation, and proper veterinary care, the Central Zoo is committed to ensuring that these birds thrive in their new home. <br>Cockatoos are a type of parrot found in the zoo. They primarily feed on seeds, nuts, fruits and insects. In captivity, they are often offered a varied diet including pellets, fresh fruits, and vegetables. A balanced diet is important for their overall health and well-being.

      <h1>Parrot</h1>
      <p>Parrots are a highly intelligent and social species of birds known for their ability to mimic human speech and other sounds. They are members of the Psittacidae family and are found in tropical regions all over the world. Parrots come in a wide range of colors and sizes, from the small Budgerigar to the large and majestic Macaw. These birds are omnivores, eating a diet of seeds, fruits, nuts, insects, and even small animals. In the wild, parrots live in flocks and are known for their strong bonds and playful personalities. In captivity, parrots can make great pets for people who are willing to provide them with the proper care and
         attention. However, it is important to research the specific needs of each species of parrot before bringing one into your home. <br>Parrot birds are omnivores and have a varied diet in the wild consisting of seeds, fruits, nuts, insects, and sometimes small vertebrates. In captive environments such as zoos, they are often fed a diet of pellets, fruits, vegetables, and seeds. It's important to provide them with a balanced and diverse diet to maintain their health and well-being. It's also important to provide them with a varied diet to prevent boredom and to provide them with stimulation. Parrots also need access to fresh water at all times to stay hydrated.

      <h1>Canary</h1>
      <p>Canaries were first bred in captivity in the 17th century, having been brought to Europe by Spanish sailors. This bird became expensive and fashionable to breed in courts of Spanish and English kings.
        Monks started breeding them and only sold the males (which sing). This kept the birds in short supply and drove the price up. Eventually, Italians obtained hens and were able to breed the birds. This made them very 
        popular, resulting in many breeds arising, and the birds being bred all over Europe.The same occurred in England. First the birds were only owned by the rich, but eventually the local citizens started to breed them and,
        again, they became very popular. Many breeds arose through selective breeding, and they are still very popular today for their voices. From the 18th up to the 20th centuries, canaries and finches were used in the UK,
        Canada and the US in the coal mining industry to detect carbon monoxide. In the UK, this practice ceased in 1986. Typically, the domestic canary is kept as a popular cage and aviary bird. Given proper housing and care, 
        a canary's lifespan ranges from 10 to 15 years.
        <br>
        Colour-bred canaries bred for their many colour mutations – Ino, Eumo, Satinette, Bronze, Ivory, Onyx, Mosaic, Brown, red factor, Green
         (Wild Type): darkest black and brown melanin shade in yellow ground birds, Yellow Melanin: mutation showing yellow ground color with brown and black pigment, 
         Yellow Lipochrome: mutation creating the loss of brown and black pigment, leaving yellow ground color etc.
        Type canaries bred for their shape and conformation – Australian plainhead, Berner, Border, Fife, Gibber Italicus, Gloster, Lancashire, Raza Española, Yorkshire, etc.
        Song canaries bred for their unique and specific song patterns – Spanish Timbrado, German Roller (also known as Harz Roller), Waterslager (also known as "Malinois"), American Singer, Russian Singer, Persian Singer.

      <h1>Mandarin Duck</h1>
      <p> Mandarin duck  white belly, pink beak, tawny brown tail feathers, and a dark green head stripe above two white eye areas. 
        Male and female mandarin ducks at Martin Mere, UK Conservation status.<br>
        The mandarin duck (Aix galericulata) is a perching duck 
        species native to the East Palearctic. It is medium-sized, at 41–49 cm (16–19 in) long with a 65–75 cm (26–30 in) wingspan. It is 
        closely related to the North American wood duck, the only other member of the genus Aix. 'Aix' is an Ancient Greek word which was 
        used by Aristotle to refer to an unknown diving bird, and 'galericulata' is the Latin for a wig, derived from galerum, a cap or bonnet.
        Outside of its native range, the mandarin duck has a large introduced population in the British Isles and Western Europe, with additional 
        smaller introductions in North America. Various mutations of the mandarin duck are found in captivity. The most common is the white mandarin
        duck. Although the origin of this mutation is unknown, the constant pairing of related birds and selective breeding is presumed to have led to
        recessive gene combinations, leading in turn to genetic conditions including leucism.
        The species was once widespread in East Asia, but large-scale exports and the destruction of its forest habitat have reduced populations in eastern Russia and in China to below 1,000 pairs in each country; Japan, however, is thought to still hold some 5,000 pairs. The Asian populations are migratory, overwintering in lowland eastern China and southern Japan.[4]
        Specimens frequently escape from collections, and in the 20th century, a large, feral population was established in Great Britain; more recently, small numbers have bred in Ireland, concentrated in the parks of Dublin. Now, about 7,000 are in Britain with other populations on the European continent, the largest of which is in the region of Berlin.[5] Isolated populations exist in the United States. The town of Black Mountain, North Carolina, has a limited population,[6] and a free-flying feral population of several hundred mandarins exist in Sonoma County, California.[citation needed] This population is the result of several ducks escaping from captivity, then reproducing in the wild.[3] In 2018, a single bird, dubbed Mandarin Patinkin, was seen in New York City's Central Park.[7]
        The habitats it prefers in its breeding range are the dense, shrubby forested edges of rivers and lakes. It mostly occurs in low-lying areas, but it may breed in valleys at altitudes of up to 1,500 m (4,900 ft). In winter, it additionally occurs in marshes, flooded fields, and open rivers. While it prefers fresh water, it may also be seen wintering in coastal lagoons and estuaries. In its introduced European range, it lives in more open habitat than in its native range, around the edges of lakes, water meadows, and cultivated areas with woods nearby.

      <h1> Peafowl </h1>
      <p> 
        Peafowl birds, also known as peacocks, are a large bird species known for their iridescent feathers and distinctive calls. They belong to the Phasianidae family and are native to India and Sri Lanka. In the wild, peafowl feed on a variety of foods, including grains, insects, and small reptiles and mammals. In zoos, their diets are often supplemented with fruits, vegetables, and grains to provide a well-rounded and balanced meal. These birds are social creatures and thrive in large groups, making them a popular attraction in zoos and aviaries around the world. They are also valued for their ornate feathers, which are used for decoration and cultural rituals in some societies.
        Peafowl birds, also known as peacocks and peahens, are members of the pheasant family and are native to South Asia and Southeast Asia. They are known for their stunning feathers, which are used for courtship displays. In the wild, peafowl feed on a variety of foods including seeds, fruits, insects, and small reptiles. When kept in captive, peafowl can be fed a diet that includes pellets, fresh greens, and fresh fruits. Pellets are formulated to provide all the necessary nutrients for the birds, including protein, fat, and carbohydrates. Fresh greens, such as lettuce, spinach, and kale, can also be offered as a source of vitamins and minerals. Fruits, such as apples, grapes, and bananas,
        can be offered as a treat and provide the birds with additional hydration. It is important to ensure that peafowl have access to fresh water at all times to prevent dehydration. They also require adequate space to roam, perch, and forage for food.<br>
