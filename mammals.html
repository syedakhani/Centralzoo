      <h1>Tiger</h1>
      <p>Tigers, a species of big cats found in Asia, are carnivores and their diet mainly consists of large mammals such as deer, boars, and buffalos. In the wild, tigers hunt and consume their prey whole, including the bones and internal organs. They are known for their strong jaw muscles and sharp teeth, allowing them to easily crush and consume the bones of their prey.

        However, in captivity, tigers are often fed with commercially available meat products, specifically formulated for large carnivores, which provide them with the necessary nutrients and protein to maintain their health. Additionally, some zoological institutions supplement their diets with bones, whole prey items, and vitamin/mineral supplements to mimic their natural diet.
        
        It is important to note that tigers have different dietary needs based on their age, size, and health status. For example, young tigers require a diet high in protein and fat to support their growth, while elderly tigers may need a diet lower in protein to reduce the stress on their kidneys.
        Tigers, one of the largest and most powerful mammals in the cat family, are carnivores and primarily feed on large prey such as deer, wild pigs, and buffalo. In the wild, tigers are solitary hunters, using their stealth and strength to ambush their prey. They have strong jaws and sharp teeth, allowing them to bite through the thick skin and bones of their prey. However, they are also opportunistic hunters and will eat smaller prey if it is available. It is important for tigers to consume a balanced diet in order to maintain their strength and overall health. In captive environments, tigers are often fed a diet of commercial meat and poultry to ensure they receive all of the nutrients they need. It's also important to note that tigers are apex predators and play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystem by keeping populations of their prey in check.

      <h1>Deer</h1>
      <p> The deer is a common mammal found in various parts of the world. They belong to the family Cervidae and are known for their distinctive antlers, which are grown and shed annually. The main diet of deer includes leaves, bark, twigs, and other vegetation. They are also known to eat fruits, acorns, and other food sources that are abundant in their habitat. Deer are considered to be herbivores and are known for their gentle and timid nature. They are often hunted for their meat, hides
        , and antlers, but also serve as important sources of inspiration and beauty in art, culture, and mythology. With their graceful movements and unique features, deer are a fascinating and beloved animal that continues to captivate people around the world. <br>
        The deer is a hoofed mammal found in many parts of the world. They are known for their unique antlers and graceful movements. There are many species of deer, including the white-tailed deer, mule deer, elk, and caribou. Their diet mainly consists of grasses, leaves, and shoots, although they may also consume bark, fruit, and lichen. Deer play a vital role in their ecosystems as they help to control plant growth and distribute seeds. They are also a popular game species and are hunted for their meat and antlers.
        The deer is a type of mammal that can be found in various habitats across the world. They are known for their distinctive antlers, which are only found on male deer, and are used in mating rituals. There are many different species of deer, ranging from small mule deer to the larger elk. The diet of a deer primarily consists of vegetation such as leaves, shoots, and grasses, though they may also consume fruits, nuts, and bark during the winter months. In the wild, deer are prey for many large predators including wolves,
        cougars, and bears. Despite this, the deer population remains strong, making them an important species in many ecosystems.
        Deer live in a variety of biomes, ranging from tundra to the tropical rainforest. While often associated with forests, many deer are ecotone species that live in transitional areas between forests and thickets (for cover) and prairie and savanna (open space). The majority of large deer species inhabit temperate mixed deciduous forest, mountain mixed coniferous forest, tropical seasonal/dry forest, and savanna habitats around the world. Clearing open areas within forests to some extent may actually benefit deer populations by exposing the understory and allowing the types of grasses, weeds, and herbs to grow that deer like to eat. Access to adjacent croplands may also benefit deer. Adequate forest or brush cover must still be provided for populations to grow and thrive.

Deer are widely distributed, with indigenous representatives in all continents except Antarctica and Australia, though Africa has only one native deer, the Barbary stag, a subspecies of red deer that is confined to the Atlas Mountains in the northwest of the continent. Another extinct species of deer, Megaceroides algericus, was present in North Africa until 6000 years ago.

      <h1>Gerrafa</h1>
      <p>Giraffes are mammals native to Africa and are known for their long necks and legs. They are herbivores and feed on leaves, flowers, and fruits found high up in trees. Their height and long necks allow them to reach food that is not accessible to other animals. Giraffes are also known for their distinctive coat patterns and are a beloved species for many people. They are an important part of Africa's ecosystems and play a crucial role in maintaining balance in their habitats. <br>
        The Giraffe, the tallest mammal in the world, is a unique and fascinating creature that inhabits the savannas of Africa. These majestic animals are known for their long necks, which can grow up to 6 feet in length, and their striking patterns of brown and white patches. Giraffes are herbivores, primarily feeding on leaves and shoots from trees such as acacia and mimosa. They are able to use their long necks to reach vegetation that other animals can't, allowing them to subsist on
         a diet that is low in nutrients but high in volume. In addition to their impressive height, Giraffes are also known for their remarkable speed, capable of running at speeds of up to 35 miles per hour. These majestic creatures are an important part of the African ecosystem, and their survival is crucial to the health and balance of the savanna habitats they call home.. Their diet primarily consists of leaves, flowers and fruits from trees. They use their long necks to reach high
          branches and leaves, and have a tongue that measures over 18 inches long. Giraffes are social animals and live in herds, often led by a dominant male. They are also known for their unique vocalizations and movements, such as swaying, humming and walking on their tiptoes.</p>

      <h1>Panda</h1>
      <p> The giant panda, also known as the panda bear or simply the panda, is a bear native to central China. This unique and captivating animal is beloved around the world for its distinctive black and white fur, and is considered a symbol of peace and friendship. At The Central Zoo, we are proud to be home to a family of giant pandas, and we take great care to provide them with the best possible care and nutrition.

        When it comes to food, giant pandas have a very specific and limited diet. They are primarily bamboo eaters, with bamboo making up 99% of their diet. They will also occasionally eat other plants, small animals and even fish, but bamboo is their primary source of food. At The Central Zoo, our pandas are fed a variety of different bamboo species, as well as other types of vegetation to ensure that they are getting a balanced and nutritious diet.
        
        One of the biggest challenges when it comes to feeding giant pandas is that they are very picky eaters. They are notorious for turning their noses up at certain types of bamboo, even if they are healthy and nutritious. This means that our keepers have to be very careful when choosing the right types of bamboo to offer to our pandas. They also have to be mindful of the age and stage of growth of the bamboo, as certain parts of the plant are more palatable than others.
        
        In addition to offering our pandas a variety of different bamboo species, we also supplement their diet with other types of vegetation and even specially formulated panda cakes. These panda cakes are designed to provide the pandas with all of the nutrients and vitamins that they need, and are made using a variety of different ingredients including carrots, apples, sweet potatoes, and more. <br></p>
